# Technical Interview Preparation Course for IntelliJ IDEA in Kotlin

## Welcome!

We are thrilled to have you join this interactive course designed to prepare you for technical interviews and familiarize you with IntelliJ IDEA (IDEA), a professional integrated development environment used by millions of software engineers worldwide.

## Learning Objectives

This hands-on course aims to achieve the following learning objectives:

1. **Practice Essential Algorithmic Techniques:**
   - Explore fundamental algorithmic techniques such as brute force, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, and dynamic programming.
   - Solve coding challenges to master each corresponding technique.

2. **Prepare for Coding Interviews:**
   - Tackle carefully selected coding challenges covering popular topics encountered in coding interviews.

3. **Code Like a Pro:**
   - Utilize IDEA's smart features (code inspections, auto-completion, on-the-fly code analysis, and reliable refactoring tools).
   - Implement solutions using a professional workflow, including writing tests and debugging within IDEA.

4. **Write Efficient and Reliable Code:**
   - Aim to implement solutions that work efficiently, even on large datasets (less than one second).
   - Validate solutions against a diverse set of test cases, including large datasets and corner cases.

5. **Practice Kotlin:**
   - Implement solutions in Kotlin, a cross-platform programming language developed by JetBrains.

## How to Approach Each Challenge

For each programming challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Read the Problem Statement:**
   - Ensure you understand all constraints to estimate the running time of your algorithm.

2. **Design an Algorithm:**
   - Attempt to design an algorithm independently.
   - Check provided hints if needed.

3. **Prove Algorithm Correctness:**
   - Verify your algorithm's correctness, ensuring it performs within reasonable limits.

4. **Implementation:**
   - Implement your algorithm in the `src/Task.kt` file.
   - Leverage IDEA's features, such as code completion and inspections.

5. **Unit Tests:**
   - Write unit tests in the `test/Tests.kt` file.

6. **Debugging:**
   - If tests fail, debug your implementation.

7. **Submission:**
   - Submit your implementation using the Run button to check against various test cases.
   - Debug if necessary until all tests pass.

8. **Enjoy the Success:**
   - Celebrate your achievement when all tests pass!

## Happy Learning!

In the upcoming challenges, we'll guide you through this process step by step. Best of luck on your coding journey!
